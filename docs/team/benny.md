### Project: TutorSynch

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to record a student's payment information. [\#59](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/59)
  * What it does: Allows the user to record the Tutoring Fee and Payment Date of a student.
  * Highlights: This command is carefully setup in a way that allows for future enhancement (such as using Payment Date to indicate late payment, early payment, or due soon). This requires carefully thought out OOP design principles.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to use custom color code for Tags. [\#73](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/73)
  * Highlights: Contains a Tooltip such that, when hovering over a tag, shows the Hex Color Code of the tag.
* **New Feature**: Updated payment information to contain payment status. [\#101](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/101)
  * Highlights: Contains `PaymentInfo.Builder` to dynamically build a `PaymentInfo` object, instead of using multiple manually-defined constructors.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.4` (2 releases) on GitHub

* **Documentation**:
  * Ui Mockup:
    * Designed `docs\images\Ui.png` and `docs\images\findLeeYuResult.png` via PowerPoint. [\#38](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/38)

    * Added documentation for the feature `payment`. [\#59](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/59)
    * Updated documentation for `paymentStatus` for the feature `payment`. [\#101](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/pull/101)
